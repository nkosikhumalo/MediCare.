<p align="center"><strong>Simple support for life insurance, policies, and claims.</strong></p>

---

Medicare is a health-insurance support app. People can sign in, get help with policies and claims, send claim documents, update some policy details, and try premium changes with a calculator.

## Architecture

```text
React + Vite web client
        │ HTTP / JSON
        ▼
Node.js + Express API ───── PostgreSQL
        │                    accounts, chat, claims
        ▼
Java + Spring Boot service ─ SQLite
                             policy chunks and RAG data
```

The web app sends requests to the Node API. Node handles sign-in and app data, and sends RAG and some business requests to Java. Java checks the JWT again and handles policy search, chat answers, and claims support.

## RAG and AI

RAG means **retrieval-augmented generation**. It helps the app answer questions using the policy guide. The Java service reads `Myriad_Technical_Guide.md`, splits it into smaller sections, and saves those sections in a local SQLite database (`policy_rag.db` by default). It also stores document versions and embedding data there.

When someone asks a question, the service finds up to eight related sections and gives them to the AI as context. In claims mode, it only searches sections tagged for death claims. Checks help keep answers within the app’s rules. If no AI provider is set up, the app shows a fallback message.

The current setting is `rag.use-mock=true`. This means RAG searches SQLite by keyword. The mock embedding client is for development and testing; it does not do meaning-based search. Java can also call an AI model when provider settings are added. Keep all passwords and API keys in environment variables. They are needed for AI-generated answers, but not to start the app locally.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL database

## Local development

### 1. Configure PostgreSQL and Node API

Create a PostgreSQL database, then create `companion-backend-node/.env` using the following values:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/medicare_db
DATABASE_SSL=false
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-secret-at-least-32-bytes-long
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
JAVA_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

The API initializes its schema from `companion-backend-node/database/schema.sql` on startup. `DATABASE_URL` can be used instead of the individual `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_PORT` values. For hosted PostgreSQL, set the appropriate SSL configuration.

Start the Node API:

```bash
cd companion-backend-node
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Configure and start the Java service

Set the same JWT signing secret in the Java process as `JWT_SECRET` (or `MOCK_JWT_SIGNING_SECRET`). Optional AI settings include `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MODEL`. The RAG SQLite file is created at `policy_rag.db` by default; set `RAG_DB_PATH` to choose another location.

From the repository root:

```bash
cd companion-backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The Java service listens on port `8080` by default. Set `JAVA_SERVICE_URL` in the Node API if you use a different address.

### 3. Start the web client

Create `companion-frontend/.env`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
```

Then run:

```bash
cd companion-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite (normally `http://localhost:5173`).

## Features

- Sign-in, registration, JWT session handling, and role-based access control
- Policy and claims support through grounded policy-document retrieval
- Claims document upload and validation
- Self-service policy updates for eligible users
- Premium what-if calculations
- Chat conversation and message persistence
- English and Sesotho UI text, theme preferences, and browser speech features

## Security notes

- Use long, random JWT secrets and keep them out of source control.
- Use HTTPS in deployed environments and restrict `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` to the client origins you operate.
- Keep database and AI provider credentials in environment configuration.
- The repository includes development-oriented mock identity and embedding behavior; configure and review identity and AI provider settings before production use.
